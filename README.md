# Matching-Loom

## What is this dapps?
Matching Loom is dapps like a Tinder App.

- All swiped data will be saved on Dapp Chain.
- You can see the tastes of matching partners. (transparent)
- It works on the side chain of Loom.
  - If you try to return token you got using fake photos back to the main chain, it will be challenged…….Not implemented🙇

## Why made?
- Because of SNS using Dapp Chain(DPos is fast), we wanted to record Instant emotions.
- We thought that it would be incentive to be swiped nice.
